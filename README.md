# sourcefinding
Various programs/tools for source finding and cleaning of Apertif HI cubes


### Step 1: sourcefinding.py
```
python sourcefinding.py -t <taskid> -b <beams> -c <cubes> -o <optionally overwrites continuum filtered file>
```
Default for beams is 0-39 (all).  
Default for cubes is 1,2,3 (nearest cubes where we expect direct detections).
First does continuum filtering in SoFiA-2 using `template_filtering.par`.  This is separate so it only has to be done once, but source finding can be repeated without recreating the same continuum filtered file over and over again. For source finding, uses a parameter file called `parameter_template_4sig.par` or `parameter_template_10sig.par` when appropriate.
Tries to check if it should do an initial high threshold cleaning (10 sigma) or not.  This seems to work on the survey data that has been tested, but not on some hand picked SVC data. 
Parameters probably need to be tweaked.

Output:  
`HI_image_cube*_filtered.fits` - used in `checkmasks.py`  
`HI_image_cube*_4sig_cat.txt`  
`HI_image_cube*_4sig_cat.xml` - could probably get rid of this  
`HI_image_cube*_4sig_chan.fits`  
`HI_image_cube*_4sig_mask-2d.fits` - used in `checkmasks.py`  
`HI_image_cube*_4sig_mask.fits` - used in `clean.py`  
`HI_image_cube*_4sig_mom0.fits`  
`HI_image_cube*_4sig_mom1.fits`  
`HI_image_cube*_4sig_mom2.fits`  
`HI_image_cube*_4sig_rel.eps `  

### Step 2: checkmasks.py
```
python checkmasks.py -t <taskid> -b <beams>
```
Default for beams is 0-39 (all).  
Plots the mask from continuum filtering (in grey) and the 2D masks of the source finding (in color) for the nearest 3 cubes or ignores if they aren't present.
Plots the HI spectrum for all sources found in `sourcefinding.py`.

Output: `HI_imaging_4sig_summary.png` and `HI_imaging_4sig_summary_spec.png`.  
(`10sig` if sources were found in high threshold source finding round).

### Step 3: (use only in the case of perfect masks) clean.py
```
python clean.py -t <taskid> -b <beams> -c <cubes>
```
Default for beams is 0-39 (all).  
Default for cubes is 1,2,3 (nearest cubes where we expect direct detections).  
Ignores beam/cube combinations which don't have a SoFiA mask generated by sourcefinding.py.  (If a catalog file is present, but not mask, program crashes out.  Means something went wrong with `sourcefinding.py`.)
Cleans the HI emission based on input mask files.  Any source selection needs to be done by hand at the moment, before running this program.  Program just takes the output mask from SoFiA results and cleans with that to 0.5 sigma.

Output:  
`HI_image_cube*_clean.fits` cleaned cube  
`HI_image_cube*_model.fits` model cube  
`HI_image_cube*_residual.fits` residual cube  

### Step 4: finalsources.py
```
python finalsources.py -t <taskid> -b <beams> -c <cubes>
```
Same defaults as above.  Create moment maps based on the existing SoFiA masks & cleaned cubes.  Moment maps are of the whole cube at the moment.  Also produce ascii text files for the HI profiles of each source.  Clean beam data is stored in the comments of the text file.  It can be accessed, for example, with `a.meta['comments'][0].replace('= ','').split()`
